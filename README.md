# Introduction to Geographic Information Science for Public Policy (PBPL 273)  
University of California - Winter Quarter 2019

Tu/Th 3:40-5:30pm, Watkins 2101 

## Course Description

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of geographic
information systems (GIS), geographic information science (GIScience),
spatial data and applications of spatial analysis in the social sciences and public policy.


The course takes an explicitly computational learning approach to its pedagogy.
Students are introduced to computational tools that are increasingly important
to public policy and social science research that engages with geospatial data.
My view is that by adopting these tools, students acquire a deeper engagement
with, and mastery of, the substantive concepts.

In the scope of a 10-week quarter course we can only introduce a handful of the
key concepts and methods relevant to GIS for Public Policy. As such, the
course is not intended as an exhaustive treatment. Instead, the goal is that
students will acquire and understanding of the more common and useful methods
and practices, and use the course as an entry point for further engagement the
field.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this course students will:


-   Posses a sound understanding of fundamental spatial concepts and theory

-   Know how to locate, import, manipulate, display, and analyze
    geographical data in open source computational tools

-   Have the ability to apply GIScience concepts and methods in public policy and
    social science research

## Prerequisites

Graduate standing or consent of instructor.

## Computational Learning

## Readings

Primary readings supporting the course will be assigned from:

de Smith, M.J, Goodchild, M.F. and Longley, P.A. (2018) _Geospatial Analysis: A Comprehensive Guide to Principles, Techniques and Software Tools_. Winchelsea Press.

## Grading

One course project and two exams comprise the course grade. The exams
will be given “in-class” on the dates listed in the schedule. The course
project will be described in detail the second meeting of class. The
grading weights and scale are as follows:

  --------------- -------- --- --------
  Component         Points A     90-100
  Midterm Exam          20 B      80-89
  Final Exam            30 C      70-79
  Project               45 D      60-69
  Participation          5 F     &lt;60
  --------------- -------- --- --------

In addition to the exams and project, course attendance is required.
Roll will be taken at the beginning of each class meeting, primarily so
that I may learn student’s name and assess student’s participation.
After two missed classes, 1 point will be deducted from your final grade
for each additional missed class.

The course may be taken Satisfactory (S) or No Credit (NC) with consent
of instructor and graduate advisor.


## Academic Integrity

The UCR student academic integrity policy lists violations in detail.
These violations fall into eight broad areas that include but are not
limited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, facilitating academic
misconduct, unauthorized collaboration, interference or sabbotage,
non-compliance with research regulations and retaliation. For more
information about the UCR student academic integrity policy, please use
the following web link
<http://conduct.ucr.edu/policies/academicintegrity.html>

## Disability accommodations

Qualified students with disabilities who will require disability
accommodations in this class are encouraged to make their requests to me
at the beginning of the quarter either during office hours or by
appointment. Note: Prior to receiving disability accommodations,
verification of eligibility from the [Student Disability Resource
Center](http://sdrc.ucr.edu/) is required. Disability information is
confidential.

## Code of Conduct

As course instructor, I am dedicated to providing a harassment-free
learning experience for all students, regardless of gender, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
or choice of operating system. All course participants are expected to
show respect and courtesy to other students throughout the semester. As
a learning community we do not tolerate harassment of participants in
any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
imagery are not appropriate in this course.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other students. Behave
professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or
exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for PBPL273.

Students violating these rules may be asked to leave the course, and
their violations will be reported to the UCR administration.

This code of conduct is an adaptation of the [SciPy 2017 Code of
Conduct](https://scipy2017.scipy.org/ehome/220975/493434/).
